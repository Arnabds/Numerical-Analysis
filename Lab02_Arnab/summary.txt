1 a) I imported numpy as np.
b) 3.141592653589793
c) 3.1416
d) Checked in google
e) float function returns floating or decimal rational representation of a number or string.
 E.g it will return 17.0 if the input is 17,
     it will return 0.0 if the input is blank i.e. print(float())
     it will return nan if the input is Nan or nan which indicates not a number 
     i.e. print(float("nan"))
     it will return inf if the input is Infinity or infinity i.e. print(float("nan"))
f) The value is 2.220446049250313*10^{-16}
g) Python is showing integer 1 for a and the floating point 1.0000000000000002 for b. 
 Yes, I can tell that.
h) No, the values are not different. This is because computer is storing all the digits as a 
 binary representation and epsilon can accomodate atmeost one space for it  which is 1. When
 it goes to 2 whose binary represetation would be 10. The computer can't accomodate that extra
 digit and deducts the last digit.
i) I chose the number 2. The code is
    x=2
j) 4,8.
k) I chose the angle 30 degree
l) np.sin(x) returns -0.9880316240928618 and np.cos(x) returns 0.15425144988758405
angles are measured in radians.
m) Under quotation it is np.sqrt(4) and without the quotation it is 2.


Ex 2) 1) Imported.
    2) Created meshPoints
    3) The code is "print(meshPoints[94])"
    4) It confirmed that the vector has 1000 elements.
    5) I ran the command.
    6) The coomand imported the library matplotlib ann we call it as plt.
       Then python has generated the graph Sin(2\pi x)
       We have printed the graph.
    7) I have created the file and observed that I can run the command from terminal itself.
